Project 1: Alternative Fuel Stations (SQL and Tableau)
I downloaded data from the U.S. Department of Energy and am analyzing it to understand how many alternative fuel stations of each type there are, and where in the country they are located.

My first step was importing the data into MS SQL Server and using SQL for Data Cleaning (Alt_Fuel_Stations_SQL_Data_Cleaning.sql)
I then did some exploratory data analysis (EDA) again using MS SQL Server (Alt_Fuel_Stations_SQL_EDA.ipynb)

Next I will visualize the cleaned data using Tableau.

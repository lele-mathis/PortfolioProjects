Project 1: Alternative Fuel Stations (SQL and Tableau)
I downloaded data from the U.S. Department of Energy and am analyzing it to understand how many alternative fuel stations of each type there are, and where in the country they are located.

My first step was importing the data into MS SQL Server and using SQL for Data Cleaning: Alt_Fuel_Stations_SQL_Data_Cleaning.sql
I am now using SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Next I will visualize the data using Tableau.
